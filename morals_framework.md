(spouting out my thougts without ai and then later processing stuff!)
i dont like to be rude to people are being nice to me and i dont like to be nice to people who are rude me.
if person is rude to you: be rude
if person is nice to you: be nice.

why? cuz: being nice to people who are rude to you are looking down upon you and if you are nice to them they'll assume that you are submissive slave who they can abuse and getaway with their bafoonary.
dont ever do that will only eternal cuckoldry.
being nice to rude people makes a horrible person. i mean what kind of person you should be to be rude to someone who is being nice. if this is how you behave then you dont deserve to be hated cuz you need taste
of your own medicine.
there are exceptions for every principle and act dynamically based on the situation.

Be useless to others so others cant use(exploit) you. and help yourself cuz nobody is obligated to help you unless you helped them previously.

you can do anything you that want in this world as a setient being without other people's validation as long as you are not harming other people unless you have to whom have harmed you in before intentionally for some sort of gratification. then it is a moral obligation to harm them to make them refrain from their harmful behavior for selfish and altruistic purpose. 

people who highlight my subtle grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes to make us look ignorant stupid are very dishonest morally inferior people who should be exposed. they dont know anything about us and they are making snap judgements about me to disregard to my general acumen that also includes my creativity. you cant call me low acumen individual.

if you dont take my problems like its your problems then dont expect me todo the same to you. i will only reciprocate your moral standards upon yourself. dont be a pathetic hypocrite.

if i dont want to talk to you just fuck off dont ask me why? i dont owe you an explanation (exceptions apply). see what happens if you violate this rule. i will
go to any level to protect my space even if it means to split you into atoms and dissolve you existentially.

i like to be silly funny and playful sometimes or perhaps most of time and i do not like people judging me cuz why do they even judge me ? if they do so ill
develop strategies to harm and petrify them.

i do what i want and i didn't ask your adive delusional lowwitt similar to midwitt. dont correct elevate your social status at the expense of putting down.
you'll have consequences.

Dont ever gaslight me and make me look stupid ill expose you or ill forcefully make you refrain from doing it again and again. i have to break your vicious cycle 
of harmful arrogant baboon behavior.

my survival is my priority and ill do anything to set myself at the top and to perserve my very existence.
