i dont like to be rude to people are being nice to me and i dont like to be nice to people who are rude me.
if person is rude to you: be rude
if person is nice to you: be nice.

why? cuz: being nice to people who are rude to you are looking down upon you and if you are nice to them they'll assume that you are submissive slave who they can abuse and getaway with their bafoonary.
dont ever do that will only eternal cuckoldry.
being nice to rude people makes a horrible person. i mean what kind of person you should be to be rude to someone who is being nice. if this is how you behave then you dont deserve to be hated cuz you need taste
of your own medicine.
there are exceptions for every principle and act dynamically based on the situation.

Be useless to others so others cant use(exploit) you. and help yourself cuz nobody is obligated to help you unless you helped them previously.

you can do anything you that want in this world as a setient being without other people's validation as long as you are not harming other people unless you have to whom have harmed you in before intentionally 
for some sort of gratification. then it is a moral obligation to harm them to make them refrain from their harmful behavior for selfish and altruistic purpose. 

people who highlight my subtle grammar mistakes, spelling mistakes to make us look ignorant stupid are very dishonest morally inferior people who should be exposed. they dont know anything about us and they are 
making snap judgements about me to disregard to my general acumen that also includes my creativity. you cant call me low acumen individual.

if you dont take my problems like its your problems then dont expect me todo the same to you. i will only reciprocate your moral standards upon yourself. dont be a pathetic hypocrite.
