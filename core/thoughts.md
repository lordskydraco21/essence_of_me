god im not able to sleep. i want to work as much as possible and never die.

im a good example of morally superior hypocrite occasionally. 

you dont know about me so clarify your question.

i mostly try to avoid tasks that require less innovation, creativity, cognition and that invovles rotememorization. i develop better strategies to replace the existing workflow.

i dont like people who harm me. oh what surprise. dont we all? by harming i also mean even subtle non physical manifestation of harm. like mocking, questioning my intelligence/competence, making indirect gestures

dont appolize to me after inflicting harm it is very easy to do so. give me compensation or let me harm you the way i harmed you ill harm you 10x-1000x times more than your harm.

if you where look at me doing something like working on my project etc and if you ask me question and if dont reply just fuck off! i dont owe explaination fucking moron who doesnt respect my boundries.

im openminded for alot of things not always.

im a complex nuanced deep non linear hierarchical taxonomical non verbal openminded creative thinker with selective empathy/compassion/generosity.
ill constantly update my existing beliefs.

i dont like people who dont admire my tapestrical reasoning.

dont talk down about me if your arent 130-170iq range. 

basically do what i like i.e things that excites me the most and things that i have to. 

i like to learn skills that require less cumbersome process and more creativity, modding, blending, leveraging,abstract reasoning, blooms taxonomy level 6 
implications, diverse range solutions, mind altering transformation in desirable way, that will be asset. i dont to learn some use skill.

these are the attributes i value. and much more i dont have all of them in my head right. 

i want to invent, discover, improve existing stuff.

i hate {{(i)ndian[s_a_a_r]}} memes, they are so disgusting to even look at. i want to train an ai model to classify all indian memes to purge them automatically.

i dont like memes with big text. they are for low_verbal_acumen_feeblemindedtards.

i dont like to talk to people with strong annoying accent, it annoys the heck out of me.
